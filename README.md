Solution to DNA sequence problem in typescript with test cases

## Problem -
The DNA sequence is made of a series of nucleotides shown as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.

When looking at DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may show the answer in any order.


**Example 1:**

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"

Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]

**Example 2:**

Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"

Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
